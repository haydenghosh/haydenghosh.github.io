## The Problem
The first time I ever learned about sinusoids was in 8th grade, just after we studied quadratic equations. I distinctly remember noticing that a sinusoid looks quite similar to a series of truncated parabolas of alternating vertical orientation, and I wondered how similar they really are. The thought was evanescent at the time, though.

## Solution
Now that we have narrowed down the problem and found the path to a solution, we can proceed with the math. Broadly speaking, we will do the following:
1. Find an equation for $x(t)$, the parabolic approximation of a sine wave.
2. Determine the Fourier series coefficients of $x(t)$.
3. Compute the overall power of $x(t)$.
4. Compute the power of the fundamental frequency components of $x(t)$.
5. Calculate the ratio of the fundamental power to the total power. This is our final answer.
6. Interpret the results.

#### Parabolic Approximation
Our first step is to find an equation for $x(t)$, which represents the parabolic approximation of a reference sinusoid $r(t) = A\sin(2\pi f_{0}t)$. We take $A=1$. For now, let us consider only the first half-period of $x(t)$, which we denote as a parabolic half-pulse $p(t)$. This half-pulse must satisfy the following properties:
- $p(t) = 0$ outside the interval $[0,T_{0}/2]$.
- $p(t)$ is parabolic with roots at $t=0$ and $t=T_{0}/2$.
- The vertex of $p(t)$ is located at $(T_{0}/4,1)$.

A general equation for $p(t)$ is then

$$p(t) = at(t-T_{0}/2)I_{[0,T_{0}/2]}(t)$$

where $I_{[\alpha,\beta]}(t)$ is the *indicator function,* defined as

$$I_{[\alpha,\beta]}(t) = \begin{cases}1, & \alpha\leq t < \beta \\ 0, & \text{else}\end{cases}$$

Plugging the vertex point into $p(t)$ and solving for $a$ gives $a = -16/T_{0}^{2}$. We thus have

$$p(t) = -\frac{16}{T_{0}^{2}}t(t-T_{0}/2)I_{[0,T_{0}/2]}(t)\quad\text{(parabolic half-pulse)}$$

All we need to do now is write $x(t)$ as a sum of flipped and shifted versions of $p(t)$. The second half-period of $x(t)$ would be $p(t)$ flipped and shifted to the right by $T_{0}/2$, so the entire first period of $x(t)$ is given by $p(t) - p(t-T_{0}/2)$. The pattern then repeats: the $n$th period of $x(t)$ is given by shifting the whole thing by $nT_{0}$. We can write this compactly using summation notation:

**Parabolic Approximation of a Sinusoid**

Consider a reference sinusoid $r(t) = A\sin(2\pi f_{0}t)$.
We can approximate $r(t)$ using scaled, shifted, and truncated parabolas as

$$x(t) = A\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} p(t-nT_{0}) - p(t-T_{0}/2-nT_{0})$$

where

$$p(t) = -\frac{16}{T_{0}^{2}}t(t-T_{0}/2)I_{[0,T_{0}/2]}(t),\quad T_{0}=1/f_{0}$$

Although this notation is concise, it may be a little difficult to interpret. Below is a visualization of what the various terms represent. Note that we have chosen $T_{0}=1$ and $A=1$.
