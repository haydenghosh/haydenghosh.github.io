## About Me
I am a rising fourth year student at UCLA's math and economics departments. While my undergraduate major is pure math, I am a "Departmental Scholar" in the economics program, which enables me to complete a Masters degree within my standard four years. 

I am also a jazz saxophonist, and the leader of the Game Music Ensemble's Jazz Band. 

## Research Interests
I'm interested in microeconomic theory broadly, with particular interests in decision theory, game theory, and behavioral economics.
